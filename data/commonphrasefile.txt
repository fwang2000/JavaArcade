Chip on your shoulder
A Dime a Dozen
All Bark and No Bite
An Apple a Day Keeps the Doctor Away
Piece Of Cake
Elephants never Forget
Apple of my Eye
Busy as a Bee
Back to the Drawing Board
Back to Square One
Barking Up The Wrong Tree
Beating around the Bush
Better Safe Than Sorry
Between A Rock and a Hard Place
Calm Before the Storm
Close but no Cigar
Cry Over Spilled Milk
Curiosity Killed the Cat
Cut to the Chase
Don't Count your Chickens before they hatch
Down for the count
Down to the wire
Dropping like flies
Elephant in the Room
Even a broken clock is right twice a day
Every cloud has a silver lining
Fight fire with fire
Fish out of water
Fool me once, shame on you
Foaming at the mouth
Go out on a limb
Happy as a clam
A Hard pill to swallow
Head over heels
Hindsight is 20/20
Hold your Horses
How do you like them apples
Hung out to dry
Sharing is Caring
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
In a Pickle
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It's not rocket science
Jack of all trades
Jump the gun
Keep your eyes peeled
Kill two birds with one stone
Knock your socks off
Let her rip
Let the cat out of the bag
like father, like son
like shooting fish in a barrel
Making a scene
Make a mountain out of a molehill
Money doesn't grow on trees
Neck and neck
Needle in a haystack
No ifs, ands, or buts
No questions asked
Not the sharpest tool in the shed
On cloud nine
open a can of worms
playing for keeps
Put a sock in it
Read em and weep
Right off the bat
Roll with the punches
Scaredy-Cat
Shot in the dark
Slow and steady wins the race
Stick a fork in it
Swing for the fences
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
The Early bird gets the worm
Throw in the towel
There's no I in team
Two peas in a pod
What goes up must come down
You can't judge a book by its cover
